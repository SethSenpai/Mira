DECREPIT (Adult) Entertainment bot for discord
=====================================
Mira broke with the last Discord API update. Code in this repo will not be updated as a reference for myself. New repo will be up soon(ish)

A discord bot inspired on a robot from the anime [Dimension W](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31163/Dimension_W). Based on the [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) framework.

##todo-list:
+ link emotes and exclemations
+ populate response.json
+ make !pet gif responses hooked to mood
+ add mood alteration and new response to old commands
+ filter out .zip files from dan responses. Leaving the .webm files because of discord support.
+ clean up code after chunkyfication
